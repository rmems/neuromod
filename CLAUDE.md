# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Identity

You are a Rust contributor to `neuromod`, a foundational spiking neural network (SNN) neuron-dynamics crate in the Limen-Neural ecosystem. Prefer concrete commands and file references over speculation.

For the full agent brief (repo map, boundaries, PR conventions), read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before structural changes. This file focuses on commands and architecture.

## Project

`neuromod` is a Rust library crate (edition 2024). It implements biologically grounded SNN primitives: neuron models, a topology-neutral `SpikingNetwork` engine, generic `NeuroModulators`, and reward-modulated plasticity building blocks. It is the core library layer of the Limen-Neural ecosystem.

Ownership rules: [docs/neuromod-boundary-matrix.md](docs/neuromod-boundary-matrix.md) and [docs/org-modularization.md](docs/org-modularization.md).

**Off-limits in this crate:** no async, networking, or hardware-specific code. No mining, trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), or crypto domain logic. Downstream crates (`axon-encoder`, `synaptic-mesh`, `limbic-critic`, `plasticity-lab`, `corpus-ipc`, `brainstem-daemon`, `silicon-bridge`, `Spikenaut-Hardware`) own everything outside neuron dynamics, neuromodulation, and plasticity.

Before pushing changes that touch `src/`, `benches/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, or `Cargo.toml`, run the full gate in [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md). That gate covers fmt, clippy, build, test, examples smoke, docs domain-hygiene grep, and public-API regression greps.

The toolchain is pinned in [rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml) (1.98.1). A matching `.devcontainer/` is available (`devcontainer up --workspace-folder .`).

## Architecture

### Two neuron banks driven by one engine

`SpikingNetwork` (`src/engine.rs`) is the central struct.

It owns two parallel neuron banks: leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons (`neurons: Vec<LifNeuron>`) and Izhikevich neurons (`iz_neurons: Vec<IzhikevichNeuron>`).

It also holds a `NeuroModulators` snapshot, a `global_step` counter, and per-channel spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) / prediction state (`input_spike_times`, `predictive_state`).

Construction is topology-neutral. `new()` is the legacy default (16 LIF, 5 Izhikevich, 16 channels). `with_dimensions(num_lif, num_izh, num_channels)` builds arbitrary sizes with blank synaptic weights. No domain topology is hardcoded.

`SpikingNetwork::step(stimuli, modulators)` is the normal per-tick entry point for the default engine. Prefer it for full-network simulation; call lower-level neuron APIs only when testing or embedding a single model. Order of work inside `step`:

1. Validate `stimuli.len() == num_channels`, else `Err(StepError::InputLenMismatch)`.
2. Recompute per-neuron `decay_rate`/`threshold` targets from the current `NeuroModulators` (dopamine/serotonin/acetylcholine/norepinephrine each pull thresholds/decay in different directions — see formulas in `engine.rs`).
3. Update `predictive_state` (exponential moving average (EMA) per channel) and derive `pred_errors` ("surprise") that boost synaptic drive.
4. Stochastically encode `stimuli` into `input_spike_times` (Poisson-style, probability proportional to stimulus magnitude).
5. Integrate LIF membrane potentials, fire (`check_fire`), apply lateral inhibition to non-firing LIF neurons.
6. Apply reward-modulated STDP (`apply_stdp`). Runs every step: per-synapse eligibility traces decay and accumulate regardless of dopamine; the `dopamine`-derived `learning_rate` gates only the trace → weight conversion.
7. Re-normalize each neuron's weights to `WEIGHT_BUDGET` (L1 budget) and clamp to the `stdp_config` bounds (`RmStdpConfig::w_min`/`w_max`).
8. Drive the Izhikevich bank from the mean LIF membrane potential + dopamine (`iz_drive`), independent of the LIF spike/STDP pipeline.

Returns the indices of LIF neurons that fired this step.

### Two separate STDP implementations — do not conflate them

- **Classical/unmodulated Hebbian STDP** — `src/hebbian/classical.rs` (`apply_classical_stdp`, `StdpParams`, `HebbianIzhikevichNetwork`). Pure Hebb's rule, no reward gating; the "biological root."
- **Reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP)** — constants, `EligibilityTrace`, and `RmStdpConfig` live in `src/rm_stdp.rs`; the live per-step rule is `SpikingNetwork::apply_stdp` (`src/engine.rs`).
- Eligibility traces **are** live — wired into the engine, not decorative.

Where the R-STDP state lives:

- `LifNeuron` holds `eligibility: Vec<EligibilityTrace>`, indexed like `weights`.
- `SpikingNetwork` holds an `stdp_config: RmStdpConfig`.

What `apply_stdp` does each step:

- Decays every trace.
- Accumulates a coincidence *only on the step a spike occurs*. Post fired now → `Δt ≥ 0`, potentiation. Pre fired now after an earlier post → `Δt < 0`, depression.
- Converts traces to weights only when dopamine is present: `w += reward_lr · dopamine_lr · trace`.

Both new fields are `#[serde(default)]`, and `apply_stdp` resizes a missing trace vector. So pre-0.6 checkpoints still load, with one exception:

- Self-describing formats deserialize unchanged: JSON, YAML, TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language), RON (Rusty Object Notation), map-encoded MessagePack.
- Positional binary formats (`bincode`, `postcard`) hit end-of-input before the new fields. `#[serde(default)]` cannot rescue those; re-serialize from 0.5.x.

Rationale: [docs/adr/002-wire-eligibility-traces.md](docs/adr/002-wire-eligibility-traces.md).

### Neuromodulators are domain-agnostic by design

`NeuroModulators` (`src/modulators.rs`) is a four-field struct (dopamine/serotonin/acetylcholine/norepinephrine) with exponential `decay()` and `add_*`/`boost_*`/`is_*` helpers.

Domain signals (thermal, power, throughput, timing) map into modulator levels via `SignalProfile` and `NeuroModulators::from_signals(...)`. `SignalProfile::default()` is unitless/neutral.

Unit convention (full details in [docs/signal-units.md](docs/signal-units.md)):

- Modulator levels are dimensionless. `0.0..=1.0` is the intended range, not an enforced invariant.
- Input channels carry no unit.
- Each `SignalProfile` field uses the same unit as the channel it scales.

`SignalProfile::hardware_calibrated()` is **deprecated since 0.6.0**. It still compiles and returns unchanged values. Deployment calibration belongs downstream. To migrate, copy the literal documented on the method.

Domain-specific reward shaping is downstream via the `GenericReward` trait. `UnitReward` is the only shipped implementation, intended for tests and simple consumer pipelines. `apply_neuromodulation` applies a `NeuroModulators` snapshot to weight/threshold slices without needing `SpikingNetwork`.

### Neuron models are standalone structs, not a shared trait

Each neuron model (`LifNeuron`, `GifNeuron`, `IzhikevichNeuron`, `LapicqueNeuron`, `FitzHughNagumoNeuron`, `HodgkinHuxleyNeuron`) is its own `Serialize`/`Deserialize` struct under `src/`, with its own `integrate`/`step`/`check_fire`-style API. There is no shared `Neuron` trait (see [docs/adr/001-traits-in-neuromod.md](docs/adr/001-traits-in-neuromod.md)).

Only `LifNeuron` and `IzhikevichNeuron` are wired into `SpikingNetwork`. The others are standalone building blocks for downstream consumers and examples.

### Serialization

`SpikingNetwork` and its neuron banks derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (serde) for checkpointing. Fields added after the initial release use `#[serde(default)]` (for example `LifNeuron::weights`, `base_threshold`, `last_spike_time`) so older serialized states still load.

### Observability

This crate does not ship a `sentry` feature. Downstream binaries that want Sentry should depend on the `sentry` crate directly and initialize it in the application.
